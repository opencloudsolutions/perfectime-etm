"<b>perfecTime ETM</b>" is a employee time and human resource management solution built for small businesses.
The application comprises of two main modules.

1. <b>Touch Enabled Time Clock Punch Panel</b>

2. <b>Manager's Web Based Control Panel</b>

The "Touch Panel" & "Manager's Panel" both connect to a centralized Relational Database. We have chosen MYSQL as our primary RDB.

"Touch Panel" module is responsible for allowing user login via a 4 digit key system or a magnetic card swipe and clock in/out is recorded as java timestamps, where as the "Manager's Panel" is responsible for simply reading and auditing those timestamps based on user 4 digits keys and/or swipe card hashed values.
